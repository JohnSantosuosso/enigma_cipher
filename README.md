## Enigma Cipher

Enigma is a Command Line Interface(CLI) app built entirely in Ruby that utilizes RSpec and TDD to provide the user with the option to encrypt a message, which can later be decrypted after the encrypted message is read from a text file. The cipher itself is built partially off of the famous 'Caesar Cipher,' with additional encryption measures and character shifts added to increase the complexity of the encryption pattern.

**_Getting Started_**

 1.  **Create a new directory on your computer where you'd like the program to live** 

     ```mkdir /Users/your_user_name/your_folder/enigma_cipher```
  
 2.  **Navigate into the recently created directory** 

     ```/Users/your_user_name/your_folder  $cd enigma_cipher ```
  
 3.  **Clone the repository by clicking on the code button on Github repo page. Then, copy the repo information using SSH.**

 4.  **Inside the recently created directory, clone the recently copied repository information** 

      ```$git clone git@github.com:JohnSantosuosso/enigma_cipher.git```

 5. **Open the repository in your preferred IDE.  If you are using VSCode, use the code command shown below.** 

     ```$code```
     
 6. **Encrypt your message.** 
      
      Locate the ```message.txt``` file inside the project.  Enter the message you wish to encrypt.
